# Web Engineering 2024-2025 / Lab 1: Git Race

Welcome to the first lab assignment of the 2024-2025 Web Engineering course! To get started, please refer to the [GUIDE](docs/GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on how to complete the assignment.

### Bonus Challenge: Earn a :gift:

Stand out from the crowd by being the first to implement one of the following advanced features and earn a special reward! Here are some ideas to consider:

- **Run the App with Docker**: Containerize the application using Docker to simplify the setup and deployment process.
- **Leverage Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to manage and run the app along with its dependencies.
- **Deploy with Kubernetes**: Utilize Minikube to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster, gaining experience with container orchestration.
- **Experiment with a Different Templating Engine**: Replace Thymeleaf with another server-side templating language to render the HTML.
- **Create a Client-Side Update with JavaScript**: Develop an endpoint that returns a message in JSON format and dynamically update the HTML on the client side, moving away from server-side MVC.
- **Integrate a Modern JavaScript Framework**: Build a single-page application (SPA) using React, connected to a RESTful web service, skipping the traditional MVC architecture.

These challenges are optional but highly encouraged as they offer an opportunity to explore cutting-edge technologies and demonstrate your skills. Be creative and push the boundaries of what this assignment can be. Good luck!
